# Windows Calculator Roadmap

Windows Calculator is under active development by Microsoft.

## Focus

In 2019, the Windows Calculator team is focused on:
* Refining our open source development process on GitHub
* Iterating upon the existing app design based on the latest [Fluent Design guidelines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design)
* Improving testing and diagnostics within the project
* Investigating new features with a focus on addressing top user feedback, including:
  * Adding the ability for users to pin Calculator on top of other windows
  * Providing additional customization options
  * [Your feature idea here] - please review our [new feature development process](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/docs/NewFeatureProcess.md) to get started!

We welcome contributions of all kinds from the community, but especially those that support the efforts above. Please see our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.

## Releases

Windows Calculator is included in every Windows 10 release as a [provisioned Windows app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/application-management/apps-in-windows-10#provisioned-windows-apps). We also deliver updates through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFHVN5) approximately monthly.
