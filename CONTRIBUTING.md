# Contributing to Calculator
The Calculator team encourages community feedback and contributions. Thank you for your interest in
making Calculator better! There are several ways you can get involved.

## Reporting issues and suggesting new features
If Calculator is not working properly, please file a report in the 
[Feedback Hub](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130&newFeedback=True).
Feedback Hub reports automatically include diagnostic data, such as the version of Calculator
you're using.

We are happy to hear your ideas for the future of Calculator. Check the
[Feedback Hub](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130) and see if others have
submitted similar feedback. You can upvote existing feedback or submit a new suggestion.

We always look at upvoted items in Feedback Hub when we decide what to work on next. We read the
comments in both Feedback Hub and GitHub, and we look forward to hearing your input. Remember that
all community interactions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Finding issues you can help with
Looking for something to work on?
Issues marked [``good first issue``](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/good%20first%20issue)
are a good place to start.

You can also check the [``help wanted``](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/help%20wanted) tag to find 
other issues to help with. If you're interested in working on a fix, leave a comment to let everyone know and to help
avoid duplicated effort from others.

## Contributions we accept
We welcome your contributions to the Calculator project, especially to fix bugs and to make
improvements which address the top issues reported by Calculator users. Some general guidelines:

* **DO** create one pull request per Issue, and ensure that the Issue is linked in the pull request.
* **DO** follow our [Coding and Style](#style-guidelines) guidelines, and keep code changes as small as possible.
* **DO** include corresponding tests whenever possible.
* **DO** check for additional occurrences of the same problem in other parts of the codebase before submitting your PR.
* **DO** [link the issue](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions) you are addressing in the 
   pull request.
* **DO** write a good description for your pull request. More detail is better. Describe *why* the change is being 
   made and *why* you have chosen a particular solution. Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.
* **DO NOT** submit a PR unless it is linked to an Issue marked 
   [`triage approved`](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Triage%3A+Approved%22). 
   This enables us to have a discussion on the idea before anyone invests time in an implementation.
* **DO NOT** merge multiple changes into one PR unless they have the same root cause.
* **DO NOT** submit pure formatting/typo changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.

We follow a [user-centered process for developing features](docs/NewFeatureProcess.md). New features
need sponsorship from the Calculator team, but we welcome community contributions at many stages of
the process.

> Submitting a pull request for an approved Issue is not a guarantee it will be approved.
> The change must meet our high bar for code quality, architecture, and performance, as well as
> [other requirements](#docs/NewFeatureProcess.md#technical-review).

## Making changes to the code

### Preparing your development environment
To learn how to build the code and run tests, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).

### Style guidelines
The code in this project uses several different coding styles, depending on the age and history of
the code. Please attempt to match the style of surrounding code as much as possible. In new
components, prefer the patterns described in the 
[C++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
and the [modern C++/WinRT language projections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/).

### Testing
Your change should include tests to verify new functionality wherever possible. Code should be
structured so that it can be unit tested independently of the UI. [Manual test cases](docs/ManualTests.md)
should be used where automated testing is not feasible.

### Git workflow
Calculator uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where most
development happens directly on the `main` branch. The `main` branch should always be in a
healthy state which is ready for release.

If your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request.
You can use [git rebase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/rebase#squash-local-commits)
to group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.

When completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. Please
let us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.

## Review Process
After submitting a pull request, members of the calculator team will review your code. We will
assign the request to an appropriate reviewer. Any member of the community may
participate in the review, but at least one member of the Calculator team will ultimately approve
the request.

Often, multiple iterations will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at
[past pull requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see
what the experience might be like.

## Contributor License Agreement
Before we can review and accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). The CLA ensures that the community is free to use your contributions. More
information about the agreement is available on the [Microsoft web site](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/).
Signing the CLA is an automated process, and you only need to do it once for Microsoft projects on
GitHub.

You don't need to sign a CLA until you're ready to create a pull request. When your pull request is
created, it is classified by a bot. If the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the
bot will label the PR `cla-not-required`. Otherwise, it's classified as `cla-required`. In that
case, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the
current and all future pull requests will be labeled as `cla-signed`.
